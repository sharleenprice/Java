ReadMeWordListIn this class we create WordList instances and other methods that are useful for a scrabble player. My public WordList throws a fileNotFound exception if user does not enter a valid file name for the constructor.The array words is then used to hold all the words in the dictionary.txt file.All the other methods throw InputMismatchExceptions in the case that the user inputs a character of the wrong format. The only issue I encountered here is for the cases that a character is input with scanner.next().charAt() if the user inputs a number instead of a letter the code does not crash as expected so exception is not thrown even though the format is wrong. It instead searched the words for a number as a first character which there is none. I could not figure out how to fix this and I figured since my code does not crash it should be fine. WordListTesterThis class tests the methods in wordlist. It takes user inputs and puts it in the argument of the methods. When user inputs an invalid file or invalid format, the code crashes but the exception is caught so the code terminates gracefully. This method also creates and writes txt files that store the list of words. This done using FileWriter and a name for each file is hardcoded.
